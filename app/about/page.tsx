        I'm a <strong>Data Scientist Intern</strong> and an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in <strong>Artificial Intelligence and Data Science</strong>, currently looking for exciting internship opportunities.{"\n"}
        {"\n"}
        My journey began back in 10th grade when I saw my cousin working on an Excel dashboard. That moment lit a spark 🔥. Being a math enthusiast and naturally curious, I began exploring—and soon stumbled upon the incredible world of data science.{"\n"}
        {"\n"}
        What captivated me was the idea that <strong>data-driven decisions are the most practical, real-world magic</strong>. Since then, I've been using data to not just solve problems but also to improve myself.{"\n"}
        {"\n"}
        I’m the kind of person whose brain never sits still. Whether it’s a power issue at home, a software glitch, or a messy Word document—my mind instinctively looks for the problem, runs through all possible fixes, and jumps into action. <strong>I love that loop: problem → solution → satisfaction</strong>.{"\n"}
        {"\n"}
        I don’t scroll mindlessly or binge-read books. My joy comes from digging into the web to understand how things work—whether it’s <strong>biological systems, tech mechanics, global politics, or scientific research</strong>. I live in curiosity mode.{"\n"}
        {"\n"}
        My learning path is fueled by <strong>self-teaching, endless experiments, and side projects</strong>. I don’t stop until something feels right to me—and others.{"\n"}
        {"\n"}
        People around me often say, “If something’s done to perfection, it’s probably by Mudassir.” I usually laugh it off, but I do take my work seriously. <strong>People trust me</strong> with what they care about—and I honor that.{"\n"}
        {"\n"}
        Whether it’s fixing a stubborn bug or completing a polished project, I take pride in every little thing I build. The <strong>effort, structure, and thought</strong> behind it are what make me proud.{"\n"}
        {"\n"}
        My dream? To contribute to <strong>AI and other emerging technologies</strong>. Even if I don’t know something today, I’ll learn it tomorrow—because that’s my mindset. 🚀{"\n"}
        {"\n"}
        I enjoy <strong>mentoring juniors</strong>, sharing creative ideas in team projects, and contributing even when it’s “not my task.” I love visual design too—I’ve created award-winning posters and impactful presentations. I naturally bring a creative angle to everything I do. 🎨{"\n"}
        {"\n"}
        Whether it's data storytelling, dashboards, or analogies to teach others—I enjoy making things understandable and engaging.{"\n"}
        {"\n"}
        I bring <strong>structure to unstructured chaos</strong>, think critically and logically, and explore solutions from multiple directions. I’m definitely a bit of a workaholic—but in the best way.{"\n"}
        {"\n"}
        People say I’m not traditionally funny—but my quirky work style and creative efforts do bring smiles. 😄{"\n"}
        {"\n"}
        <strong>If you’ve read this far</strong>, I guess I’ve amazed you just a little.{"\n"}
        If you’re a stranger, I’d honestly love to meet you, hear your story, and learn something new from you too.{"\n"}
        {"\n"}
        <strong>Lots of love ❤️</strong>{"\n"}
        {"\n"}
        <strong>“I HOPE IT WAS WORTH THE SCROLL” 📜✨</strong>
